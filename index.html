      <p>
        My name is Chaz Beauchamp and I am currently training to work in the
        field of web development. I am originally from Indianapolis, Indiana but
        currently reside in Durham, North Carolina. Outside of programming, my
        hobbies include sports, games, and television.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Since graduating from college in 2021, I have worked as a college
        adviser for the Duke College Advising Corps, serving students at both
        Lee County High School and City of Medicine Academy. While serving as a
        college adviser, I have simultaneously studied under Code The Dream's
        Introduction to Programming class, learning skills in HTML, Javascript,
        CSS, and more.
